          <h2>About me:</h2>
          <p>
            I am Full Stack Developer with 5 years of experience, I have a strong background in both frontend and
            backend development, using JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, CSS3, and frameworks like React, Angular, and .NET.
            I devote my free time to mastering and improving my skills and sharing my knowledge with others!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am always up for a CSS challenge üéâ
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm looking for a full stack position with a focus on frontend. I'm open to trying new technologies because
            I'm more interested in the problem I'm solving than in the language I'm using to solve it.
            I find great value in projects that tackle pressing issues like web accessibility or other ways to make
            technology work for the betterment of society.
            One notable project involved migrating a project from Ruby on Rails to .NET Core. I played a key role (as
            one of the developers in a team of two working on this task) in Dockerizing the legacy components for
            migration to Azure, developing a new UI in Umbraco to replace Ruby-rendered pages, and improving the
            performance of the Ruby application.
          </p>
          <p>
            One interesting aspect of my life outside of work is my passion for diverse hobbies:
          <ul>

            <li>
              At home, I'm an board game enthusiast üé≤, with a growing collection of them.
            </li>
            <li>
              When I'm on vacation, my wife and I seek adventure in the great outdoors, whether it's hiking up mountains
              üåÑ or swimming to nearby islands üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
            </li>
